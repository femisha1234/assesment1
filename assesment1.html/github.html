    <h1>Github</h1>
    <h4>GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and offers a suite of tools for collaboration
        and project management.
        It is widely used for hosting and sharing code repositories, managing projects, and collaborating with other
        developers.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Repositories: A repository (or "repo") is where your project resides. It contains all your project files and
            each file's revision history.</li>
        <li> Branches: Multiple versions of a project can be developed simultaneously using branches.</li>
        <li> Pull Requests (PRs): A pull request is a way to propose changes to the repository. It allows for code
            review and discussion before merging changes.</li>
        <li> Issues: GitHub Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other project-related work.</li>
        <li> Actions: GitHub Actions automate workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
